                    My name is Nina Alblas. I am 21 years old and I live in Krimpen aan den IJssel.
                    I am currently in the fourth year of my bachelor Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam.
                    Since last year I felt that I had "missed" a large part of my student life because of the coronavirus, 
                    I voluntarily extended my bachelor time with another year.
                    
                    I tutor mathematics to high school students of all levels; vmbo, mavo, havo and vwo.
                    I also work as a study advisor for the UvA, where I provide information about Communication 
                    Science at secondary schools, open days and trial study days. 
                    In this way I hope to be able to help future students with their choice of study. 
                    In the past semester, I also worked as a Teaching Assistant in the Minor Artificial Intelligence, 
                    again at the UvA.
